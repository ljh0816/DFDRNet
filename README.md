üîç Overview
In this work, we propose DFDRNet, a real-time semantic segmentation framework that addresses feature misalignment and representation insufficiency in dual-resolution networks.
Our method introduces:

A deeply fused dual-resolution encoder for better spatial-semantic feature integration;

An attention-guided feature fusion module (AFFM) to reduce feature redundancy and enhance alignment;

A classification-guided semantic supervision branch to improve global context awareness and category discrimination.

DFDRNet achieves high accuracy with low inference latency, making it suitable for real-time vision tasks such as autonomous driving, AR/VR, and robotic perception.
